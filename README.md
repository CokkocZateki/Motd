# MOTD App



The templates live in `motd/templates/motd/` and can be
extended to suit your needs.  To use the app add `motd` to your
`INSTALLED_APPS` and include `motd.urls` in your project URL
configuration.  MOTDs can be managed through the Django admin interface.

After installing the app, run `python manage.py migrate` to create the
database tables for storing MOTDs.
